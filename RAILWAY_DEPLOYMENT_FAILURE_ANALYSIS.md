# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FAILURE ANALYSIS
**User Management Service - Troubleshooting Report**
*Generated: August 28, 2025 - 17:15 IST*

## üîç ISSUE IDENTIFICATION

### Primary Issues Discovered & Resolved:

#### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: JWT Secret Length**
- **Problem**: JWT secret was too short (32 bytes) for HS512 algorithm  
- **Error**: `JWT secret key is too short for HS512 algorithm. Current length: 32 bytes, required: at least 64 bytes (512 bits)`
- **Solution**: Extended JWT_SECRET to 128 bytes in Railway environment variables
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

#### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Health Check Path**  
- **Problem**: Health check was configured for `/actuator/health` but app uses context path `/api/auth`
- **Expected Path**: `/api/auth/actuator/health` 
- **Solution**: Updated railway.json health check path
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

#### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Environment Variables**
- **Problem**: Missing required environment variables for Railway deployment
- **Solution**: Added all required variables:
  ```bash
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway
  DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://...
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME=org.postgresql.Driver
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... 
  UPSTASH_REDIS_PORT=6379
  JWT_SECRET=<128-byte-key>
  ```
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Current Deployment Status:
- **Build**: ‚úÖ Successfully builds on Railway (Maven compilation passes)
- **Environment**: ‚úÖ All required variables configured
- **Configuration**: ‚úÖ Railway.json, nixpacks.toml properly configured  
- **Local Test**: ‚úÖ Application starts locally with railway profile
- **Health Check**: ‚ùå Still not responding on Railway

## üöÄ VERIFICATION PERFORMED

### Local Testing Results ‚úÖ
```bash
# SUCCESSFUL LOCAL START
Started UserManagementServiceApplication in 22.479 seconds
Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/api/auth'
```

### Railway Environment ‚úÖ  
- All required environment variables set
- Nixpacks configuration optimized for monorepo structure
- Health check timeout set to 90 seconds
- Build command successfully creates JAR file

### Configuration Files ‚úÖ
- **logback-spring.xml**: Railway profile with minimal logging
- **application-railway.properties**: Optimized for Railway deployment  
- **railway.json**: Correct health check path `/api/auth/actuator/health`
- **nixpacks.toml**: Proper build and start commands

## üîß NEXT TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### Potential Remaining Issues:

1. **Database Connection**
   - Supabase PostgreSQL might be timing out during startup
   - Connection pool configuration might need adjustment
   - SSL/TLS certificate issues with Supabase

2. **Memory/Resource Limits**
   - Railway free tier might have memory constraints
   - JVM heap size might need optimization
   - Build process might be consuming too much resources

3. **Flyway Migration Issues**
   - Database migrations might be failing
   - Migration scripts might not exist in correct location
   - PostgreSQL schema/user permissions

4. **Redis Connection**
   - Upstash Redis SSL connection might be failing
   - Connection pool configuration issues
   - Health check disabled but connection still being attempted

## üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check Railway Deployment Logs** (via web dashboard)
2. **Disable Flyway temporarily** for testing
3. **Simplify startup** - disable Redis, use minimal configuration
4. **Add debug logging** to capture startup failures

### Configuration Adjustments:
```properties
# Temporary debug configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
spring.flyway.enabled=false
spring.redis.timeout=1000ms
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
```

### Alternative Approaches:
1. **Deploy with H2 Database** initially to isolate database issues
2. **Use Dockerfile approach** instead of Nixpacks
3. **Deploy minimal configuration** and add features incrementally

## üìä CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Local Build** | ‚úÖ Working | Maven compilation successful |
| **Local Startup** | ‚úÖ Working | Starts in 22 seconds with railway profile |
| **Railway Build** | ‚úÖ Working | Nixpacks builds JAR successfully |
| **Railway Startup** | ‚ùå Failing | Application not responding to health checks |
| **Environment Vars** | ‚úÖ Complete | All required variables configured |
| **Configuration** | ‚úÖ Complete | All config files optimized |

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS FOR USER

1. **Access Railway Web Dashboard**: Check deployment logs for specific startup errors
2. **Consider Simplified Deployment**: Try with minimal config (H2 + no Redis) first  
3. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Check if hitting Railway free tier limits
4. **Test Database Connectivity**: Verify Supabase connection from Railway environment
